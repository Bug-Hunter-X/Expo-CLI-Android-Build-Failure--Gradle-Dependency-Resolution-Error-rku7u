This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message related to the Android Gradle Plugin, indicating that it cannot find a specific dependency or version.  This can happen even if the project's `build.gradle` file appears correctly configured.  Sometimes the error is vague, such as a generic 'failed to resolve' error without much detail, making it challenging to diagnose.
