The solution may involve several steps, starting with a project clean and cache invalidation: 
```bash
./gradlew clean
```
Next, check network connectivity to ensure Gradle can access online repositories.  If the issue persists, examine the detailed error messages from Gradle carefully. They may indicate a missing or conflicting dependency.   If a specific dependency is identified, update or add it to the appropriate `build.gradle` file. For example: 
```gradle
//In your app level build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1" //or any missing/conflicting dependency
}
```
Consider updating your Expo CLI and related packages:
```bash
expo upgrade
npm install
```
If issues continue, exploring solutions through community forums or by creating a minimal reproducible example might be beneficial.  As a last resort, building the Android project using Android Studio outside of Expo's build process could provide additional insights into the error.
